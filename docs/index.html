              The self watering flower pot program runs extremely well when plugged directly into an external computer. However, when a 9V power supply is plugged into the arduino, all four pumps will turn on at once. This is because the wiring diagram provided by WayinTop has a single error: The positive power jumper that is connected to the relay board should be plugged into the 5V power pin, and not the VIN power pin. The wiring diagram for the relay board and the arduino should look like this:

              <p>Programming the arduino to run the pumps and the sensors was very simple as the arduino has to only do two things: read the sensor input and turn the pumps on and off accordingly. In order to understand what sensors were returning, I added a set of code in the loop section to return the sensor reading from each pot. This also allowed me to fine tune the timing for when the pumps turn on to fall into the following ranges:</p>

              <p>When I layed out all of the electronics and put the pumps into individual cups, I realized that the cups were far too small to act as reservoirs for each of their respective pots. The pumps themselves easily consumed 30% of the space in the cups, so I had to find an alternate solution. I bought a food safe container that contains the same volume as at least 3 of the flower pots I am using and suspended the pumps in the reservoir through a hole that can also be used to refill the reservoir using a funnel. I also put the electronics on top of the reservoir as it is probably the safest position for the electronics since they are above any liquids that could damage the delicate electronic components.</p>
