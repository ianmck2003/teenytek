              <p>I tried to build a drone, and ended up making an angry bee. When I spun up the motors for the first time it said, &quot;5 more minutes&quot; and threw its front right propeller at me. I was perplexed as to how the drone got my sleeping habits. Like project like builder perhaps?</p>

              <p>After spending over a year and a half in quarantine, I've gotten extremely tired of vented masks being downplayed as &quot;ineffective&quot; because they let virus particles through their vents. Because of this, I have set out to start making vented masks that are easier to breath with, but do not leak virus particles into the air. I also want the mask to look good and be usable for day to day life.</p>

              <p>I have recently been working at St. Thomas School as an IT Intern, and they recently have asked me to design and produce battery pack protectors for their battery supply. The main problem that needed to be solved was protecting the plugs from fall damage, as the plugs could destroy the battery if lateral force is applied to the plugs. I came up with a simple 3D printed design that looks like a little hat that goes on top of the battery with a hatch that the plug can go into. It is more than adequate to protect the plugs from fall damage, while keeping the battery pack looking new and refined.</p>

              <p>I have recently come into possession of a CR-10S Pro V2 3D printer. It is a large form factor printer with a 30cm by 30cm by 40 cm workspace that is capable of printing with most 3D printing filament with a high degree of accuracy. While I was doing research on 3D printers however, I found that there were several areas that the printer was lacking in. The biggest thing was the lack of an all metal hotend. The stock hot end is incapable of surviving the temperatures experienced by printing with hotter materials such as ABS or PETG, so I had to replace the hotend with a MicroSwiss all metal hotend.</p>
