              <p>When I layed out all of the electronics and put the pumps into individual cups, I realized that the cups were far too small to act as reservoirs for each of their respective pots. The pumps themselves easily consumed 30% of the space in the cups, so I had to find an alternate solution. I bought a food safe container that contains the same volume as at least 3 of the flower pots I am using and suspended the pumps in the reservoir through a hole that can also be used to refill the reservoir using a funnel. I also put the electronics on top of the reservoir as it is probably the safest position for the electronics since they are above any liquids that could damage the delicate electronic components.</p>

              <p>Following the recommended wiring diagram was farily easy requiring only a few rows on a breadboard. I decided to use two small breadboards to keep things organized, and I will be looking for ways to make things more compact as I go. The Wayintop kit you can buy on amazon comes with all the parts you need, but I did have to do some refinement to make them more usable. This is only an issue with the pumps, as the leads on them are extremely small and I don't want to risk damaging the waterproof coating on the wires since I have to submerge the pumps in the reservoir. To solve this problem, I spliced some red and black wire to the positive and negative poles respectively, giving me an extra 1 1/2 inches of wire to work with.</p>

              <p>The idea is to create a self watering flower pot using an arduino, a moisture sensor, and a pump in a water bucket. The arduino will take the data input from the sensor and determine if the soil is too dry. If the soil is too dry, it will activate a pump and run until the soil is moist enough. It will then stop the pump while the arduino waits a set amount of time before priming the system again.</p>
