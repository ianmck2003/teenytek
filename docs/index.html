              <p>I built an open source drone following instruction from Doctor Peter Dalmaris' Udemy course, Make an Open Source Drone. The course is very detailed, and I was able to build the drone in a very short amount of time. I followed the build instructions for the version based on a PixHawk 2.4.8 flight computer, and flying it has been highly enjoyable for me.</p>

              <p>It has been about a month since I finished the self watering flower pot. I have only refilled the reservoir once during that time period, and I am very happy with the amount of growth I have seen from the plants. I did encounter a single issue with pump 1 ceasing to work, but I replaced the pump and the system is working again. I am currently working on the data hub idea, but it is requiring me to do a lot of research on different libraries I will need to monitor my system.</p>

              <p>With the completion of the self watering system for the flower pot, I discovered a serious flaw with my system. In order to get data from my Arduino Uno, I had to directly connect a laptop to the Arduino. However, even with the direct connection I couldn't see data over time, resulting in me only getting a real time idea of how the moisture levels are doing. After consulting the resources that I have, I decided that I should find a way to have the Arduino pass its information to a Raspberry Pi, which will then allow me to remotely connect via wifi to a web server to see the sensor data in real time, as well as sensor data in the past on a graph.</p>
