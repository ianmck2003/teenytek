          <h1>AFK Fishing Bot Idea</h1>
<!-- Excerpt Start -->
<p>In Minecraft 1.16, the single block AFK fish farm design no longer produced treasure pulls, making it largely useless. Personally, I do not enjoy fishing in Minecraft because while it yields very useful treasure such as books of mending and high level protection, the time it takes for a rod to catch something is just too slow and boring for me. Even with the highest level of Lure I cannot Fish in Minecraft for more than 5 minutes before I get bored and decide to go do something else.</p>
<!-- Excerpt End -->
<p>Recently my father provided me a link to a very interesting Minecraft bot creater built around Node.js (the same framework used by the static site generator <a href="/blog/making-teenytek/">Eleventy</a>. I believe that I can build a bot that will not only fish for me while I'm away from my computer, but even while I'm working on other things while I'm at my computer. I could become the richest man on my dad's Minecraft server if I built this bot correctly, but it would have to have two settings with two different processes:</p>
<h2>AFK Fish Farm Clicker</h2>
<p>This version of the bot will simply continously right click until the fishing rod it is using is too low on durability, or until I tell it to stop. It should also switch to a new fishing rod if its current rod gets too low on durability.</p>
<h2>Pond Fisher</h2>
<p>This version of the bot is much more complicated as it must do all of the following</p>
<ol>
<li>Pull in the line every time the bobber dips</li>
<li>When its inventory becomes full, it must go to an empty chest in a nearby storage building and deposit everything in its inventory that is not a fishing rod, and should also deposit any fishing rods below 1/4 durability.</li>
</ol>
<p>I will probably start by making AFK Farm Clicker, then learn how to make the Pond Fisher afterwards, as it will take much more time and research to do.</p>
