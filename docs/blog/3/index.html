        <p>Programming the arduino to run the pumps and the sensors was very simple as the arduino has to only do two things: read the sensor input and turn the pumps on and off accordingly. In order to understand what sensors were returning, I added a set of code in the loop section to return the sensor reading from each pot. This also allowed me to fine tune the timing for when the pumps turn on to fall into the following ranges:</p>

        <p>When I layed out all of the electronics and put the pumps into individual cups, I realized that the cups were far too small to act as reservoirs for each of their respective pots. The pumps themselves easily consumed 30% of the space in the cups, so I had to find an alternate solution. I bought a food safe container that contains the same volume as at least 3 of the flower pots I am using and suspended the pumps in the reservoir through a hole that can also be used to refill the reservoir using a funnel. I also put the electronics on top of the reservoir as it is probably the safest position for the electronics since they are above any liquids that could damage the delicate electronic components.</p>

        <p>Following the recommended wiring diagram was farily easy requiring only a few rows on a breadboard. I decided to use two small breadboards to keep things organized, and I will be looking for ways to make things more compact as I go. The Wayintop kit you can buy on amazon comes with all the parts you need, but I did have to do some refinement to make them more usable. This is only an issue with the pumps, as the leads on them are extremely small and I don't want to risk damaging the waterproof coating on the wires since I have to submerge the pumps in the reservoir. To solve this problem, I spliced some red and black wire to the positive and negative poles respectively, giving me an extra 1 1/2 inches of wire to work with.</p>

        <p>The idea is to create a self watering flower pot using an arduino, a moisture sensor, and a pump in a water bucket. The arduino will take the data input from the sensor and determine if the soil is too dry. If the soil is too dry, it will activate a pump and run until the soil is moist enough. It will then stop the pump while the arduino waits a set amount of time before priming the system again.</p>

        <p>TeenyTek.com was originally a learning project for me to learn how to use Eleventy and Node.js to maintain a much larger site built by me and my father, FarmerFrog.org. My father was the chief architect of the Farmer Frog Website, as the high school web development team did not have the knowledge or experience to rebuild the original site in the required timeframe. In order to compensate for the partial removal of the learning curve, my father recommended that my team and I build our own blog pages to practice using html, nunjucks, and css. The current iteration of the Farmer Frog website that we have been working on since September of 2020 uses so little javascript that we are not being required to use javascript, but I will most likely implement some javascript in the future since our client is already planning out features.</p>
