          <h1>3D Printed Mask</h1>
<!-- Excerpt Start -->
<p>After spending over a year and a half in quarantine, I've gotten extremely tired of vented masks being downplayed as &quot;ineffective&quot; because they let virus particles through their vents. Because of this, I have set out to start making vented masks that are easier to breath with, but do not leak virus particles into the air. I also want the mask to look good and be usable for day to day life.</p>
<!-- Excerpt End -->
<p>As my template, I have found a mask dubbed &quot;COVID Hunter Mask&quot; by its creator anikinet on thingiverse. It is a pretty cool looking design with very strong sci-fi features that really caught my eye as I was scrolling through various designs.</p>
<p><img src="/img/covid-hunter-mask.png" alt="COVID Hunter Mask"></p>
<p><img src="/img/mask-print-img1.jpg" alt="COVID Hunter Mask Print"></p>
<p><img src="/img/mask-print-img2.jpg" alt="COVID Hunter Mask Print"></p>
<p>I printed this mask to get an idea of how the mask will feel and to get the dimensions I should expect to see on a mask like this so I can make similar designs in the future. I will be using filters from cloth masks to make a thicker filter pad that will hopefully be more effective and easier to breath with than the cloth masks most people use today.</p>
