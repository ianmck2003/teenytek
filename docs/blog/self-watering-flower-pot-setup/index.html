<!-- Excerpt Start -->
<p>When I layed out all of the electronics and put the pumps into individual cups, I realized that the cups were far too small to act as reservoirs for each of their respective pots. The pumps themselves easily consumed 30% of the space in the cups, so I had to find an alternate solution. I bought a food safe container that contains the same volume as at least 3 of the flower pots I am using and suspended the pumps in the reservoir through a hole that can also be used to refill the reservoir using a funnel. I also put the electronics on top of the reservoir as it is probably the safest position for the electronics since they are above any liquids that could damage the delicate electronic components.</p>

<p>After this I simply had to put the piping and the moisture sensors into the dirt in the flower pots. I will be growing basil in the pots since it is a farily hardy herb, and I have grown basil in multiple experiments as a child (hydroponics, nutrient experiments, growth medium experiments, and more). I will be using nutrient spikes to maintain soil nutrient levels since it is the simplest to install (blue dots in image).</p>
