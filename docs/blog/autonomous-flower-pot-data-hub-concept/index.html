          <h1>Autonomous Flower Pot Data Hub Concept</h1>
<!-- Excerpt Start -->
<p>With the completion of the self watering system for the flower pot, I discovered a serious flaw with my system. In order to get data from my Arduino Uno, I had to directly connect a laptop to the Arduino. However, even with the direct connection I couldn't see data over time, resulting in me only getting a real time idea of how the moisture levels are doing. After consulting the resources that I have, I decided that I should find a way to have the Arduino pass its information to a Raspberry Pi, which will then allow me to remotely connect via wifi to a web server to see the sensor data in real time, as well as sensor data in the past on a graph.</p>
<!-- Excerpt End -->
<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>The goal of upgrade to the Self Watering Flower Pot is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Allow me to remotely access the sensor data</li>
<li>Allow me to see data over time</li>
</ol>
<h2>Expected Changes</h2>
<p>There are two major changes that I will have to make to my arduino code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Store sensor data in a single array instead of four individual variables</li>
<li>Remove the print to serial monitor</li>
</ul>
<h2>Expected Additions</h2>
<p>The only major addition from a hardware perspective is a Raspberry Pi 3 connected to the arduino through the microusb port on the arudino. The Raspberry pi will have the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>pull the sensor data array and store the values in a data file</li>
<li>host a web server to allow me to view and analyze data from the data file, as well as let me see what the current sensor values are in real time</li>
<li>allow me to change moisture values based on what I think would be best for the plants (Optional until later)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Raspberry pi will also allow me to pull data from future systems such as PH monitoring systems, plant monitoring systems, etc. I will hopefully be able to finish this upgrade in the next couple of weeks.</p>
