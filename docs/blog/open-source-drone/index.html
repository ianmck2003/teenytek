<!-- Excerpt Start -->
<p>I built an open source drone following instruction from Doctor Peter Dalmaris' Udemy course, Make an Open Source Drone. The course is very detailed, and I was able to build the drone in a very short amount of time. I followed the build instructions for the version based on a PixHawk 2.4.8 flight computer, and flying it has been highly enjoyable for me.</p>
<!-- Excerpt End -->
<p>I did not build the drone entirely for fun. I also built it to learn how to use hobby electronics such as brushless motors, electronic speed controllers, as well as power distribution boards and power modules. This will allow me to built other remotely controlled vehicles such as cars, boats, and planes. I am hoping that I will be able to integrate a more powerful computer into a remotely controlled vehicle built around the PixHawk to allow me to create a fully automated vehicle.</p>
