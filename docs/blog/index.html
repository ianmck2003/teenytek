        <p>It has been about a month since I finished the self watering flower pot. I have only refilled the reservoir once during that time period, and I am very happy with the amount of growth I have seen from the plants. I did encounter a single issue with pump 1 ceasing to work, but I replaced the pump and the system is working again. I am currently working on the data hub idea, but it is requiring me to do a lot of research on different libraries I will need to monitor my system.</p>

        <p>With the completion of the self watering system for the flower pot, I discovered a serious flaw with my system. In order to get data from my Arduino Uno, I had to directly connect a laptop to the Arduino. However, even with the direct connection I couldn't see data over time, resulting in me only getting a real time idea of how the moisture levels are doing. After consulting the resources that I have, I decided that I should find a way to have the Arduino pass its information to a Raspberry Pi, which will then allow me to remotely connect via wifi to a web server to see the sensor data in real time, as well as sensor data in the past on a graph.</p>

        <p>The self watering flower pot program runs extremely well when plugged directly into an external computer. However, when a 9V power supply is plugged into the arduino, all four pumps will turn on at once. This is because the wiring diagram provided by WayinTop has a single error: The positive power jumper that is connected to the relay board should be plugged into the 5V power pin, and not the VIN power pin. The wiring diagram for the relay board and the arduino should look like this:</p>

        <p>In Minecraft 1.16, the single block AFK fish farm design no longer produced treasure pulls, making it largely useless. Personally, I do not enjoy fishing in Minecraft because while it yields very useful treasure such as books of mending and high level protection, the time it takes for a rod to catch something is just too slow and boring for me. Even with the highest level of Lure I cannot Fish in Minecraft for more than 5 minutes before I get bored and decide to go do something else.</p>

        <p>Programming the arduino to run the pumps and the sensors was very simple as the arduino has to only do two things: read the sensor input and turn the pumps on and off accordingly. In order to understand what sensors were returning, I added a set of code in the loop section to return the sensor reading from each pot. This also allowed me to fine tune the timing for when the pumps turn on to fall into the following ranges:</p>
