          <h1>Lithophane</h1>
<!-- Excerpt Start -->
<p>Today is my wonderful girlfriend's 17th birthday, and I wanted to make her something special. Something that reflected our relationship but also was useful and durable. As I was scrolling through reddit (as most guys do when they aren't creative) I saw someone mention making a lithophane for their significant other. When I did some research, I found that there were generators that could take an image and generate an .stl file that could be used to print out a solid version of an image.</p>
<!-- Excerpt End -->
<p>I decided to make my girlfriend a lithophane of a photo that we loved so much that we had both used it as our background pictures for a while on our phones, but quickly found that printing lithophanes was an extremely difficult process that needed a lot of attention to complete. For starters I needed 0.1 mm layers, which would best show the details of the image. I also had to print the image vertically because the details go to 0.4 mm if printed horizontally. I printed a case for some back lighting using 0.2 mm layers, and the internal support structure resulted in a cool textured glow when turned on.</p>
<p>I think Lithophanes are a very simple but fun to make project that anyone could make if they had the right tools. I might start selling lithophanes of places around me to make a little side money in the future.</p>
