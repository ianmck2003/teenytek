# Self Watering Flower Pot Update
<!-- Excerpt Start -->
It has been about a month since I finished the self watering flower pot. I have only refilled the reservoir once during that time period, and I am very happy with the amount of growth I have seen from the plants. I did encounter a single issue with pump 1 ceasing to work, but I replaced the pump and the system is working again. I am currently working on the data hub idea, but it is requiring me to do a lot of research on different libraries I will need to monitor my system.
