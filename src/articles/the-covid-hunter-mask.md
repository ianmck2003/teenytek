# The COVID Hunter Mask
<!-- Excerpt Start -->
The COVID Hunter Mask by Anikinet on Thingiverse is the first 3D printed mask that I have made. It is a fairly large mask but it fits over my face nicely, so I will probably use similar dimensions for my masks in the future. The filter attachment points are a bit tight fresh off the bed, but with a little bit of sanding they fit together very nicely. I expect to only need a minimal amount of gasketing to seal the filter segments, and the central filter's muzzle has a very lip around the edges that I can use silicon or epoxy to make airtight.

Sanding is probably the hardest part of this mask. The sleek angles and built in strap holes make it very hard to work the sandpaper into the little nooks and crannies of the mask, but I think that the mask will look amazing after being sanded alone. I have also decided (with the help of my lovely girlfriend) to paint my mask Olive Green. I might put some Warhammer 40k decals on it to add a little big of my personality to it, leaning more towards the Cadians than the Death Korp of Krieg like my dad suggested. I might make him one in the future that has DKK decals and shading.
