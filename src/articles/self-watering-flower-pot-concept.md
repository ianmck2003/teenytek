# Self Watering Flower Pot Concept

The idea is to create a self watering flower pot using an arduino, a moisture sensor, and a pump in a water bucket. The arduino will take the data input from the sensor and determine if the soil is too dry. If the soil is too dry, it will activate a pump and run until a second dc water sensor detects the water level is high enough. It will then stop the pump and the water will drain while the arduino waits for a set amount of time before waiting for the soil moisture sensor to trigger the system again.
