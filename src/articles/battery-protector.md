# Battery Protectors
<!-- Excerpt Start -->
I have recently been working at St. Thomas School as an IT Intern, and they recently have asked me to design and produce battery pack protectors for their battery supply. The main problem that needed to be solved was protecting the plugs from fall damage, as the plugs could destroy the battery if lateral force is applied to the plugs. I came up with a simple 3D printed design that looks like a little hat that goes on top of the battery with a hatch that the plug can go into. It is more than adequate to protect the plugs from fall damage, while keeping the battery pack looking new and refined.
