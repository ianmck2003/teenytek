# New 3D Printer
<!-- Excerpt Start -->
I have recently come into possession of a CR-10S Pro V2 3D printer. It is a large form factor printer with a 30cm by 30cm by 40 cm workspace that is capable of printing with most 3D printing filament with a high degree of accuracy. While I was doing research on 3D printers however, I found that there were several areas that the printer was lacking in. The biggest thing was the lack of an all metal hotend. The stock hot end is incapable of surviving the temperatures experienced by printing with hotter materials such as ABS or PETG, so I had to replace the hotend with a MicroSwiss all metal hotend.

After making the nozzle replacement, which took a very short amount of time, I replaced the stock Creality firmware with a community built version of the Marlin 3D printer firmware. This gave my printer thermal runaway protection at the cost of being able to restart prints if power was cut to the printer in the middle of a print. I then used the complementary 100g spool of filament to make some filament guides to help the material feed into the extruder without slowly scratching material off on the edge of the input hole.

I have had experience 3D printing things before, and having a working printer has opened many doors up to me again, as I have been unable to print anything for a few years. I hope that I will be able to make some amazing projects in the future that can not only help me but the people around me.
