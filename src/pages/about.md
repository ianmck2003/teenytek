# About the Site

This site was built using a static site generator called Eleventy. It is the first of many tech projects that I plan to do in the future.

## About me

<img class="image-right" src="/img/site-profile-pic.jpg" alt="Profile pic"> I am currently a High School Student at Bellevue High School who is exploring a newfound interest in AI and robotics. I'm hoping to be able to make small autonomous vehicles using Rasberry Pis, Arduinos, and any other tech I find along the way.
